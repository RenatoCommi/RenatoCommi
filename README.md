- 👋 Hi, I’m @RenatoCommi
- 👀 I am a musician, and I want to put my music at the service of a movement with a regenerative focus, aiming at a human relationship between people where the main value is this very relationship with care and love for each other. And all together in a logic of abundance generating a good of common use.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the network movement and how it can become distributed, or at least decentralized.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with the enterprises that are organizing themselves in this decentralized way that manage to integrate production with pleasure.
